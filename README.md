## Usage

The goal of this lesson was two fold. One get used to using Webpack, which I can say 100% I have done. It was a bit of a learning curve to start. Step two was to generate the site almost entirely dynamically in Javascript and levarge module exports. For me, this was one of the hardest challenges, not because of the technical content but because of the instructions from top... 1.) by default webpack minifies content, which makes debugging in chrome a total bitch. 2.) see 1. 3.) there are a few ways to get wp to stop minifying, it was easy enough to figure out. 4.) TOP instructions do not say anything about the script tag needing to be at the bottom of the page for you to hook the content id. It makes sense after the fact, but it was a bit of a challenge to figure out why my content was not working correctly, amplified by the fact that its hard to debug a minified js file.

All in all it was a great learning exp, my site is ugly and I have zero design skills and zero graphics skills, but I felt I learned a bit on this one.
